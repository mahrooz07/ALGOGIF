# ALGOGIF: Interactive Data Structures Visualization with Python and Flask

ALGOGIF is an innovative project designed to help learners understand and visualize fundamental data structures through dynamic animations and interactive operations. This project showcases four core data structures: Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Binary Tree, implemented in Python with a Flask API and visualized dynamically.

---

## Features

- **Interactive API**: Use Postman or similar tools to interact with the data structures through endpoints for insert, delete, and search operations.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Real-time GIF animations to demonstrate data structure transformations.
- **User-Friendly Code Structure**: Modular implementation for scalability and ease of understanding.

---

## Project Structure

- **NLP_engine.py**: Handles the core logic for parsing user queries and routing operations to the respective data structure.
- **main.py**: Manages the Flask application, defines API endpoints, and integrates visualization logic.
- **LinkedList.py, Stack.py, Queue.py, BinaryTree.py**: Contain the implementations of the respective data structures, including operations and visualization logic.
- **Postman Integration**: Provides a simple interface to interact with the API for performing and testing operations.
- **Visualizations**: Generated using `matplotlib` and converted into GIFs for a clear, dynamic demonstration of data structure operations.

<H1>How It Works</H1>
<h2>Linked List:</h2> Supports insertion, deletion, and visualization of nodes with arrows to indicate connections.
<h2>Stack:</h2> Demonstrates LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations with clear GIF animations of push and pop operations.
<h2>Queue:</h2> Highlights FIFO (First In, First Out) operations with visual representation of enqueue and dequeue.
<h2>Binary Tree:</h2> Visualizes binary tree creation, traversal, and updates with parent-child relationships connected by lines.


<h3>The output of these GIFs are store in the static folder or else we can change the folder in the given code in gifgenerator.py</h3>
